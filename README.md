Anything in <> is an optional argument, if there is a * in the <> this means mod only.

  - !followage <username*> - Will show the date that you started following the channel.
  - !topclips <clip number 1-5>(without args is mod only) - Will show you the top clip from 1-5 based on the argument you pass it.
  - !uptime - Will show you how long the stream has been live.
