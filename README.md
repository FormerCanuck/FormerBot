A list of FormerB0t's commands:

Anything in <> is an optional argument, if there is a * in the <> this means mod only.

  - !followage <username*> - Will show the date that you started following the channel.
  - !topclips <clip number 1-5>(without args is mod only) - Will show you the top clip from 1-5 based on the argument you pass it.
  - !uptime - Will show you how long the stream has been live.
  - !serverage <set* | clear*> ex !serverage set: (2019-06-23) - This command allows the streamer / mods to set a start date for a server(different games will save different start dates) and allows users to do !serverage to see how long the server has been up.
  - !youtube - Will show the last upload from streamers youtube channel, how long ago it was posted and also give you the link to said upload.
